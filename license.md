Development Draft

<https://github.com/creditstxt/credit-license>

## Purpose

This license allows everyone as much permission to work with this software as possible, while protecting contributors from liability and requiring credit for their work.

## Agreement

In order to receive this license, you have to agree to its rules.  Those rules are both obligations under that agreement and conditions to your license.  Don't do anything with this software that triggers a rule you can't or won't follow.

## Notices

Make sure everyone who gets a copy of any part of this software from you, with or without changes, also gets the text of this license or a link to the URL above.

## Copyright

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe that contributor's copyright in it.

## Patent

Each contributor licenses you to do everything with this software that would otherwise infringe any patent claims they can license or become able to license.

<!-- Start Add-On -->
## Credit

You must give this software and each contributor credit for contributing to goods or services that you develop, test, produce, or provide using this software.

## How to Give Credit

In general, you must give credit in such a way that others can freely and readily find a written notice identifying this software, by name, as a contribution to your goods or services, as well as each contributor, by name, as a contributor to this software.  You must not do anything to stop others from sharing, publishing, or using credits.

## Conventions

If widespread convention dictates a particular way to give credit for your kind of good or service, such as by end credit, citation, acknowledgment, or billing, then follow that convention.  For software provided to users to run on their own computers, give credit in documentation, notice files, and any "about" page or screen.  For software provided as a web service, give credit in `credits.txt` according to <https://creditstxt.com>.

## Who to Credit

If contributors provide their names or the name of this software along with the software in a conventional way, such as in software package metadata or on an "about" page or screen, you may rely on the names they provide that way to be accurate and complete.  If contributors don't provide names that way, but include a link to a homepage for this software, you must investigate that homepage for names to credit.  If contributors provides neither names to credit nor a link to a homepage, you do not have to do independent research to find names to credit.

## Right to Decline

On written request from a contributor, you must remove their name from the credits for your good or service going forward.  On written request from all contributors to this software, you must do the same for the name of this software.

<!-- End Add-On -->
## Excuse

If anyone notifies you in writing that you have not complied with [Notices](#notices) or [Credit](#credit), you can keep your license by taking all practical steps to comply within 30 days after the notice.  If you do not do so, your license ends immediately.

## Reliability

No contributor can revoke this license.

## No Liability

***As far as the law allows, this software comes as is, without any warranty or condition, and no contributor will be liable to anyone for any damages related to this software or this license, under any kind of legal claim.***
